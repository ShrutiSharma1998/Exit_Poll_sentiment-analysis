# Exit_Poll_sentiment-analysis


The project aimed to read the views of the public via the twitter platform, Pre and Post elections. 

1. Using API we were able to extract the data from twitter, certain wordset was used to collect spcific tweets for the project.
2. Every tweet was parsed, or broken down, to simpler versions where redundened words were removed, and important words such as party names and the sentimental words attached in the tweet was retained. 
3. A corpus was build in order to analyse the picked words, and it was run over the extracted tweets. 
4. Python was leveraged for the project, and with 70% accuracy the project was successfully implemented.
